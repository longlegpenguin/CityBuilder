## Name
City Simulation - Utopia

## Description
A tycoon -like real-time city builder game.

## Usage
The player is given a well-defined area consisting of square fields. They can build their own city in
this area and manage it as a mayor with wide powers. Overall, the city consists of different types of
zones (on which residents build automatically), service buildings to be built separately by the player,
and the roads connecting them. The player's goal is to develop a prosperous city where the citizens
are happy and the budget is balanced.

The player receives some starting capital for the initial construction of the city, but they must rely on
tax revenues for further developments. The game plays in real time, but time will pass much faster
compared to reality. The game should indicate the time (year, month, day), and it is possible
to play the game in 3 different speeds, as well as to pause it.
